# Fermats-Test-Example
Generates random binary numbers to use with fermats test algorithm

This basically tests about 100 random n-bit integers to see if they are prime or not and determine the error frequency between the fermats test(fast and not as accurate) and the brute force method(slow but accurate)

This program uses a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to either compute fermats test or use 
a brute force method to determine if a number is prime or not
